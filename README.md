# Anchain_AI UC Berkeley Data X Project Spring 2020


Creating ml models to classify whether or not an EOS account registered on the EndlessGame dApp is a bot. Data is not availalbe in this repo as a result of an NDA that had to be signed with the advising company:https://www.anchain.ai

This project was a part of the UC Berkeley Data X Spring 2020 class.

## 1. Data
The data provided to us by Anchain.Ai is transaction data from the EOS Endless Game dApp.

## 2. EDA
See EDA_part1 for how the data was initially explored to understand features and given labels

See EDA_part2 for how temporal nature of transaction data is explored


## 3. Feature Engineering
Raw transaction data is taken to create 17 temporal features that can be used for training in a mL model

This is showcased in the first part of the notebook of FeatureEngineering_and_Semi_SupervisedLabelSpreading.ipynb

This notebook produces a datafile called Clusteringdataset.csv, which is used in Clustering.ipynb to explore unsupervised techniques to label and separate data.


## 4. DataLabeling and Semi_supervised labeling

Datalabeling and Semi_supervised labeling is described in FeatureEngineering_and_Semi_SupervisedLabelSpreading.ipynb

The output of the semi_supervised lableing is pseudolabeled.csv
This dataset is used in the Final_ML.ipynb


## 5. Clustering

Clustering is described in Clustering.ipynb. The input to this notebook is the Clusteringdataset.csv as generated by FeatureEngineering_and_Semi_SupervisedLabelSpreading.ipynb


## 6. Final ML

Final_Ml is described in Final_ML.ipynb. The input to this notebook is the pseudolabeled.csv produced at the end of FeatureEngineering_and_Semi_SupervisedLabelSpreading.ipynb.
